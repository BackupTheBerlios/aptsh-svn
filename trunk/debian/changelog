  * If SIGINT is received while executing an internal command now,
    only the command is stopped, not the Aptsh.
  * Accidentally removed code refreshing packages cache after 
    installing/removing packages. Now fixed.

aptsh (0.0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug in printer.c. May had caused strange behaviour of orphans-*
    commands on some architectures (ie. ppc). Closes: #383875.
  * Fixed bug in rls and ls commands - if given argument matched files in
    current directory (wildcard), in some shells names of these files were
    used instead of typed text.
  * Aptsh can be run with commands as arguments, this will work now:
    aptsh remove wajig
  * Fixed many minor bugs, added many minor features.
  * Done many internal improvements, the code seems to be clean now.
